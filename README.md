## LAB 10 - I/O INTERRUPT
[DONE]: PART 1

[IN PROGRESS]: PART 2

- ~~Create Part 2 Files~~

- ~~Add JTAG UART interrupt~~

- Add timer (200MHz) interrupt before IDLE (generate interrupt every 0.5 seconds)

  - Base address 0xFFFEC600

  - Load value (#0) - to countdown from

  - Control value (#0):

    - Prescaler - to slowdown countdown;

      prescaler of 1 slows down countdown by 1 cycle (slows down by half)

      prescaler of 3 slows down by 4 times

      99 slows down to 1% of original rate

      maximum prescaler is 255, so using 200 is easier (500kHz)

      putting 250000 in load will ensure 2Hz

      $$200\times10^6 \text{Hz} = 2\text{Hz} \times (100\times10^6)$$

    - I - generate interrupt (should be set to 1)

    - A - Auto reload (should be 1)

    - E - Enables timer (should be 1)

- Add code to configure timer

- Extend SERVICE_IRQ to process interrupts generated by the timer

[TODO]: PART 3

- Create part 3 files

- Configure JTAG UART to interrupt when detecting keyboard

- Extend SERVICE_IRQ to process new interrupts

- Modify IDLE loop

[TODO]: PART 4

- Create part 4 files

- Create second process PROC1

- Copy code from LAB 8 - PART 4

- Remove code that updates LEDs

- Create global variable CURRENT_PID

- Add global array PD_ARRAY

- Modify SERVICE_IRQ

## LAB 9 - RECURSIVE FUNCTION

[X] TODO: Modify main function to test all three cases

[X] TODO: Modify main function to test each case only on HIGH switch signals

[X] TODO: Modify recursion function so middleIndex is stored in R11 and backed up to memory

[X] TODO: Modify recursion function so r4 is passed into stack as argument

[X] TODO: Modify recursion so all register that might get overwritten is backed up to memory

## LAB 7 - Branching

[X] TODO: added modifications to program counter

[X] TODO: make datapath and FSM work with new prog


## LAB 6 - RISC MACHINE PART 2 - MEMORIES AND FSM

**Implemented FSM controller and RAM for Datapath**
